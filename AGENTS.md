# Envoy agent guide

## Current release scope — October 9, 2026

The user chose to finish Qwen-Envoy as a public technical case study: the trained
code-execution worker, its environment, reproducible saved evaluation, and the
Studio trace inspector. Read `docs/TECHNICAL_CASE_STUDY.md` and `CODEX_HANDOFF.md`.
Paper recommenders, method finders, new memory products, new benchmark tasks, and
additional training are outside this finishing pass. The user subsequently
authorized explicit QASPER attribution, official scoring of saved answers, and
one bounded NVIDIA/Nebius reference run on the same 40 questions. That run is
documented in `release/qasper-agent-study/EXPERIMENT.md`; no other paid runs or
Runpod launch are included. Display the project as QASPER Agent Studio, a Qwen
Envoy case study. It adapts QASPER; it is not an original question dataset or an
official full-test QASPER leaderboard result.

The weekly-digest/Obsidian plans and their success gates below are historical
product goals, not blockers for publishing this narrower case study. Publishing
the study does not mean those gates were achieved. Keep the safeguards and
evidence distinctions below; never fill an independent human review with model
judgments or equate a mechanical artifact check with answer correctness.

Read [the Astra improvement brief](docs/GPT_ASTRA_IMPROVEMENT_BRIEF.md) before changing
the training or reward code. It records the current evidence, research, and order of work.

The user chose the executable-code track on September 15, 2026: Qwen writes Python against
`search()`, `read()`, and `extract()` to explore a personal Obsidian snapshot. Read
[the code-execution second-brain plan](docs/CODE_EXECUTION_SECOND_BRAIN.md) and
[the weekly research radar product plan](docs/WEEKLY_RESEARCH_RADAR.md). The JSON-action research
agent and QASPER routing/reranker track are paused unless their data is retargeted to code-execution
trajectories.

- Preserve the user's uncommitted changes in `scripts/train_grpo_custom.py`,
  `tests/test_grpo_loss.py`, and `docs/QWEN_TRAINING_RESEARCH_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
- Treat `src/env/reward.py` as the active reward definition. Historical reward formulas in
  `README.md`, `RESULTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, and `PLAN.md` are not authoritative until reconciled.
- That reward applies to MuSiQue, not research synthesis. Research quote-integrity checks are
  not semantic support judgments or training rewards. The 20 starter questions are unreviewed
  development prompts, not gold labels or a held-out test set.
- Keep the task multi-step and tool-mediated. Do not collapse it into a one-shot classifier.
- Make each experiment reproducible: record checkpoint identifier, question split and IDs,
  corpus revision, policy decoding settings, reward version, hardware, and seed.
- Prefer small, isolated changes followed by the narrowest meaningful verification. Do not run
  another costly training job until a baseline over the personal-vault task has named questions,
  reviewed outputs, and a decision rule.

The user wants an evidence-based improvement, not a speculative rewrite. State the hypothesis,
the expected signal, and the decision rule before each material experiment.

The project succeeds only if both gates pass:

1. **Usability:** the user receives a useful weekly AI-research digest in Obsidian and can query
   the accumulated evidence through MCP from a larger assistant.
2. **Model improvement:** on the same held-out code-execution tasks, trained Qwen must outperform
   base Qwen on supported-answer quality without unacceptable regressions in execution failures,
   latency, or cost.

Do not substitute MuSiQue reward, QASPER conversion coverage, valid JSON, real quotation spans, or
a working MCP connection for those product gates. They are component checks, not project success.
